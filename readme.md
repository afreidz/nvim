This is my neovim setup. The color-scheme is based on [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) with
some darker backgrounds.  The setup is loosely based off of [NeoVim from Scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)
with inspirations from [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) / [this siduck post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/mkra3w/bspwm_living_inside_neovim)
